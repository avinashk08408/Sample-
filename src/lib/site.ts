// OMERTÀ 2K26 — SITE CONFIGURATION
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Every editable event value lives in this one file. Edit here and the whole
// site, form, countdown and confirmation emails update together.
//
// ⚠️  Values marked "EDIT-ME" are working placeholders. Provide the real
// numbers before launch (see README -> "Before You Go Live").
//
// ⏰  DATE WARNING: the working dates below (13 March 2026) are already in the
// PAST relative to today. The registration form auto-SEALS once the deadline
// passes, so while you develop you MUST point `registrationOpenISO` and
// `registrationDeadlineISO` at future dates (or the form shows "The book is
// sealed" and /api/register refuses every request).
