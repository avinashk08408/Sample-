            Most hackathons ask you to invent something new. At OMERTÀ 2K26 we do the opposite: your
            team is handed a working — but deliberately broken — application, riddled with real,
            findable vulnerabilities. Your job is not to write a product. It is to inspect the
            machine, discover its flaws, and repair them under a deadline.

          <p className="mt-4 leading-relaxed text-parchment/75">
            You will hunt for broken authentication, injection holes, exposed secrets, weak access
            controls and quiet logic errors. Every fix is scored — not just for proving a flaw
            exists, but for the quality of the patch, and your ability to defend it before the
            judges in a short review. This is the work of an application-security engineer, compressed
            into one long day.

            The Whitehat Club, under the Department of Cyber Security, exists to teach security by
            doing. A keyboard warrior who has never defended a live system is a story untold. We run
            OMERTÀ to give students of every department a safe, structured arena to make — and learn
            from — the mistakes that real teams make. No prior hacking experience is required, only
            curiosity and a steady nerve.
